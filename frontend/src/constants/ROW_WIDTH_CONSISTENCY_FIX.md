# Controls Tab Row Width System-Wide Consistency Fix

## Issue Identified
The Controls tab had inconsistent row widths compared to the Overview tab:
- **First row (Quick Presets)**: Full width (12/12)
- **Second row**: Split layout - Fan Control (8/12) + Sensor Configuration (4/12)

This created visual inconsistency where the second row appeared narrower than the first row, differing from the Overview tab's full-width pattern.

## System-Wide Standard Analysis
- **Overview Tab (Dashboard)**: All DataTable components use full width with consistent vertical stacking
- **Expected Pattern**: Each major component/card should span the full container width for visual consistency

## Solution Applied
Updated `/src/components/Controls.tsx` to follow the system-wide full-width pattern:

### Before:
```tsx
{/* Second Row - Fan Control (8/12 width) */}
<Grid item xs={12} sm={8} sx={{ display: 'flex' }}>
  <FanControlCard onDebugLog={onDebugLog} />
</Grid>

{/* Second Row - Sensor Configuration (4/12 width) */}
<Grid item xs={12} sm={4} sx={{ display: 'flex' }}>
  <SensorConfiguration />
</Grid>
```

### After:
```tsx
{/* Second Row - Fan Control (full width) */}
<Grid item xs={12}>
  <FanControlCard onDebugLog={onDebugLog} />
</Grid>

{/* Third Row - Sensor Configuration (full width) */}
<Grid item xs={12}>
  <SensorConfiguration />
</Grid>
```

## Key Changes
1. **Removed column spans** - All Grid items now use `xs={12}` (full width)
2. **Changed layout from 2-column to 3-row** - Each component gets its own full-width row
3. **Removed flex display override** - No longer needed with full-width layout
4. **Updated row numbering** - Sensor Configuration is now "Third Row" instead of sharing second row

## System-Wide Consistency Achieved
- ✅ **Overview Tab**: Full-width DataTable components with consistent vertical spacing
- ✅ **Controls Tab**: Full-width card components with identical vertical spacing
- ✅ **Row Spacing**: Both tabs use `SPACING.ROW` (24px) between sections
- ✅ **Card Spacing**: Both tabs use `SPACING.CARD` (16px mobile, 24px desktop) for internal spacing

## Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All Controls tab cards now span full container width
- ✅ Visual consistency matches Overview tab layout pattern
- ✅ Responsive behavior maintained on all screen sizes

This fix ensures that all tabs follow the same full-width row layout standard, providing a consistent user experience across the entire application.
